### Research Catalog

**Title:** Tibeto-Vietnamese Vajrayana: Origins, Adaptations & Futures  
**Publisher:** Vajra Academic  
**Editor:** Stephen Christopher

#### Abstract

After an empowerment ceremony to his Vietnamese sangha, a former student of Chöden Rinpoche explained: “No doubt about it: Vietnam is the number one fastest country \[for supporting Tibetan Buddhism]. We share many commonalities: Buddhism, culture, and even history. The difficulties that Tibetans went through from the 1950s, a similar thing happened in Vietnam. These similarities bring us emotionally close to each other.” This research catalog draws on fifteen months of fieldwork between 2018-24 and quantitative data at the Database of Religious History to explore the origins, adaptations and futures of Tibetan Buddhism in Vietnam. We have coined the umbrella term ‘Tibeto-Vietnamese Vajrayana’ (TVV) to capture the diverse assemblage of mainstream lineages, religious-adjacent civic institutions, teacher-centered ‘private’ sanghas, spiritual businesses, and hybrid, syncretic, and indigenized forms across Vietnam in the past 15 years. In seven chapters, we explore how TVV is positioned within late-socialist minoritization practices; the anthropological and demographic factors driving its popularization; its transmission through new forms of media and pop culture; its adaptive changes; and how it intersects with queerness and marginalized communities in Vietnam. Each chapter has rich visual material taken from a 45-day exhibition on the same subject hosted in Ho Chi Minh City in 2026. All chapters are co-authored to enhance polyvocality.
