## Utilizing Quantitative Data in Religious Therapy Associations

**Date:** March 31, 2025  
**Time:** 3-5pm (GMT)  
**Moderators:** Stephen Christopher and David Johnson

### Workshop Overview

The aim of this workshop is to integrate the experiential knowledge (and therapeutic gaps) of spiritual therapists from varied backgrounds into the questions that will constitute the New Religiosities Poll. These associations are on the global front line of making psychological data about well-being actionable for specific religious communities.

Through a lightly moderated discussion about values, gender, health and finances, we will strive to find commonalities between data useful for religious therapists and scholars of religion alike. In Year 3, we will have a follow-up workshop to share preliminary project findings.

## ‘New Religiosity Poll’ Creation Workshops
The New Religiosity Poll is being developed through a series of collaborative workshops. 
We began this work by holding a series of sessions with experts on specific themes, topics and traditions coming from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and areas of study. These workshops and one-on-one discussions worked towards developing consensus about group inclusion criteria and definitions. 
We also began to consider how to frame poll questions that are both generic enough to encompass the diversity of global traditions as well as specific enough to be able to potentially test relevant hypotheses about new religiosities.

**Hybrid Brainstorming Workshops**
**Dates:** 1-3 April 2025
**Moderators:** Stephen Christopher and Suzanne Newcombe
